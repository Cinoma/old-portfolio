## ðŸ‘‹Hi There!  ðŸ‘€
Thank you so much for checking out my Github and Portfolio. It's still a work in progress but I wanted to showcase some of the skills I already have
including my ability to release subsequent improved iterations with detailed comments.    

### :computer:Bug List:
- [ ] Search Bar is currently just a placeholder and functionality will be added at a later date.
